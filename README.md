Implements the 2005 paper by Lefebvre and Hoppe (Lefebvre, Sylvain, and Hugues Hoppe. "Parallel controllable texture synthesis." ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG). Vol. 24. No. 3. ACM, 2005.) in Matlab. 

Includes the Gaussian Stack approach of section 3.1, including the bells and whistles of coherent synthesis and k-coherent search.

No parallelism or optimisation.
